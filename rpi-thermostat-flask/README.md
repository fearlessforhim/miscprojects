# rPiThermostat
This is a small python web server for a custom home thermostat I build with a rasperry pi. I used Flask as a simple web layer and a service that I wrote to interface with the pi's hardware. This allow me to control the heat in my home from my phone.

Obviously the simpler option would be to buy a Nest thermostat, but where's the fun in that?
