As far as I can tell by the code, this application should be fully functional. When I run the application with A*Search and Greedy First Search the program find the solution relatively quickly. All printing functions work as expected and all solutions that are found are correct.

Unfortunately, the other three algorithms (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Uniform Cost Search) all seem to take a very long time. Long enough that they couldn't find the answer within 15 minutes of running. It is a possibility that my computer is not powerful enough to handle the amount of data being stored with the large number of states. Given a large enough amount of time. All my implementations should work correctly.
